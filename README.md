  - {WARNING} Krieg875 is a placeholder account for me to learn gitHub
    
  - I'm focusing on learning basic web architecture, and developing A.I at a novice level
    
  - However I'm interested in compiler design, to further my understanding of the inherent processing of my code

  - Here's a list of programming languages I understand
  - Java(advanced)
  - C/C++(advanced)
  - Rust(novice)
  - Python(novice)
  - HTML/CSS(novice)
  - Javascript(beginner)

  - I also plan to learn Go later this year
